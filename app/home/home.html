    <h1>Build analytic apps easily!</h1>

    <p>This template provides a code base from which advanced analytics web applications can be built. It is built
        using AngularJS and contains recommended coding conventions and styles. The template contains samples of
        different angular components so that bootstrapping your project is as easy as copying and modifying the existing
        files. In addition, most of the required development and testing tools are pre-configured.</p>

    <br/>

    <h3>Further Example</h3>
    <p>If you need further guidance, an example visualization was built using this template. That project can be found
        <a href="#">here.</a>
